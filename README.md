# Sheep-and-Wolves-Riddle
Sheep and wolves problem is a widely known riddle that aims to find the most optimal way to carry all sheep and wolves from one side to another with a boat. Of course, there are a few given constraints to add complexity to the problem: The number of wolves cannot outnumber the number of sheep on either side when both are present on the same side to prevent wolves preying on the sheep, and the boat has to carry at least one and at most two animals when traveling across the river. Given this problem, one is tasked to design an AI agent that can intake any given initial state to solve for the most efficient list of steps to carry all animals to the other side of the river. The AI agent is equipped with a dumb generator function and a few smart tester functions and  applies Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm to achieve its goal. Ultimately, it demonstrated fairly optimal performance in solving for a given set of initial states within a relatively short time frame.
